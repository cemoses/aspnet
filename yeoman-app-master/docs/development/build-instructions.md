# Build instructions

We're using [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) to package and distribute the app. To build the app run `./scripts/build.js`. This will call `electron-packager` with the relevant parameters. When the build is complete, you will see a "Build task completed" message in your terminal. This build is available under `./build`.
